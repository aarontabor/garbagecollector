Ongoing course assignments for Dynamic Memory Management at UNB. In these
assignments, a memory management sub-system will be constructed.


This project will be completed using Python v3.x. Correct behavior of the
project is being maintained using a test-suite leveraging the pytest module. All
tests can be run using the command in the top-level directory:

	py.test

To run a single test file, specify the filename:

	py.test <filename>


Experiementation for each assignment will be automated using shell scripts.
These scripts will be named following the convention: 'assignment<x>.sh' and can
be found in the './assignment_scripts' directory. For correct functionality,
please invoke these scripts from the top-level directory. For example (from the
top-level directory):

	./assignment_scripts/assignment1.sh <args> <go> <here>
